# A private conversation

## content

```
Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat.

The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it.

A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly.

I got very angry. I could not bear it. 

I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.

"It's none of your business," the young man said rudely. 

"This is a private conversation!"
