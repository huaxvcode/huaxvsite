# Breakfast or lunch

## content

### 原文

```
It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays.

I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime.

Last Sunday I got up very late. 

I looked out of the window. It was dark outside.

'What a day!' I thought. 'It's raining again.'

Just then, the telephone rang. It was my Aunt Lucy.

'I've just arrived by train,' she said. 'I'm coming to see you.'

"But I'm still having breakfast," I said.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"I'm having breakfast," I repeated.

"Dear me!" she said. "Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!"
