# Please send me a card

Postcards always spoil my holiday.

Last summer, I went to Italy. 

I visited museums and sat in public gardens. 

A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. 

Then he lent me a book.

I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word.

Every day I thought about postcards. 

My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends.

On the last day I made a big decision. 

I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards.

I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!
