Postcards always spoil my holidays.

Last summer, I went to Italy.

I visited museums and sat in public gardens.

A friendly waiter taught me a few words of Italian. 

Then he lent me a book.

I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word.

Every day I tought about postcards. 

My holiday passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends.

On the last day, I made a big decision.

I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards.

I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card.

It was Sunday. 

I never get up early on Sundays.

I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime.

Last Sunday, I got up very late.

I looked out of the window, it was dark outside.

What a day, I thought, It's raining again.

Just then, the telephone rang.

It was my Aunt Lucy.

I've just arrived by train she said I am coming to see you.

But I'm still having breakfast I said.

What are you doing? she asked.

I'm having breakfast I repeated.

Dear me, she said, Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock.

Last week I went to the theatre. 

I had a very good seat.

The play was very interesting, but I didn't enjoy it.

A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me, they were talking loudly.

I got very angrily. I could not hear the actors.

I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily.

They did not pay any attention to me.

In the end, I could not bear it.

I turned round again, I can't hear a word, I said angrily.

It's none of your business, the young man said rudely.

This is a private conversation.

I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim.

He is in Australia.

He has been there for six months

He is an engineer.

He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.

He has just bought an Australian car and he has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia.

He will soon visit Darwin.

From there, he will fly to Perth.

He has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very interesting.
