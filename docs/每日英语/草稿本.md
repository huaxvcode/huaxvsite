Mr.James Scott has a garage in silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury. But he cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first letter from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance only three minutes. Up to now, Mr.Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In this way, he has begun his own private 'telephone service'.
