In spite of this, she often appears on the stage as a young girl.
尽管如此，她却经常以小姑娘的身份出现在舞台上

Jennifer will have to take part in a new play soon.

This time, she will be a girl of seventeen.
这次，她要扮演一个 17 岁的少女

In the play, she must appear in a bright red dress and long black stockings.
演出时，她必须穿一条鲜红色的裙子和黑色的长筒袜

Last year in another play, she had to wear short socks and a bright, orange-coloured dress.
去年在演另一个剧时，她不得不穿短袜和一件鲜艳的橘红色衣服

If anyone ever asks her how old she is, she always answers, "Darling, it must be terrible to be grown up!"
如果有人问她多大岁数了，她总是这样回答：亲爱的，长成大人真可怕啊
