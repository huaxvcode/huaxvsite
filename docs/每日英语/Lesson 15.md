# Lesson 15

```
The secretary told me that Mr.Harmsworth would see me.

I felt very nervous when I went into his office.

He did not look up from his desk when I entered.

After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad.

He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries.

Twenty people had already left.

I knew that my turn had come.

'Mr Harmsworth', I said in a weak voice.

'Don't interrupt', he said.

Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!
