```
I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street.

Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door.
昨天一个乞丐来敲我的门

He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer.

In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs.
作为回报，那乞丐头顶地倒立起来，嘴还唱着歌

I gave him a meal.

He ate the food and drank the beer.

Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away.

Later a neightbour told me about him.

Everybody knows him.

His name is Percy Buttons.

He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.
