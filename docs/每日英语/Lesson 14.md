# Lesson 14

```
I had an amusing experience last year.

After I had left a small village in the south of France,

I drove on to the next town.

On the way, a young man waved to me.

I stopped and he asked me for a lift.

As soon as he had got into the car, 

I said good morning to him in French and he replied in the same language.

Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all.

Neither of us spoke during the journey.

I had nearly reached the town,

when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?'

As I soon learnt, he was English himself!
